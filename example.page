            The [b]NoTrollPlzNet Library[/b] (officially titled the [b]People's Knowledgebase[/b];
            also referred to as [b]the library[/b], [b]notroll library[/b], or [b]/paranoia/[/b]
            when referring to the web division) is the official library operated and managed
            by [[NoTrollPlzNet]]. The library is well known around the world due to its
            interior beauty and unbelievable size. With [@stats.library.books] books in 2008,
            it has remained the largest [!library!] in the world by both number of [!books!]
            and shelf space since its initial stocking in early 1801.[ref] The NoTrollPlzNet
            Library houses more historical information than any other library in the world,[ref]
            dating back to [!before humans were smart enough to date things | Prehistory!]
            (assuming humans even existed at the time.)
    }

    p {
            The library likely earned its popularity from [[Foxy]], the librarian and head of
            the facility. A logical politician and a well-known fashion model, she unarguably
            boasts to be the single reason the library continues to thrive to this day. Foxy
            founded the library in 1800.[dnl]
    }

    p {
            Recent studies indicate that the library is the most visited system of its kind on
            the globe.[ref] While many similar facilities close as their visitors lose interest
            (likely due to the widespread availability of the Internet), the NoTrollPlzNet
            Library's traffic numbers have continued to increase with each year that has
            passed since its founding.[ref]

        NoTrollPlzNet Library, originally named Troll-Free-Library, was built
        singlehandedly by [[Foxy]] with a $60,000,000,000 grant from the
        [!Chinese Government | Government of the People's Republic of China!].
        The money was donated by request of [[Kim Jong-il]], former supreme leader of the
        [!Democratic People's Republic of Korea!] and dear friend of Foxy.[ref] The
        construction of the library lasted merely two weeks due to Foxy's surreal muscular 
        capabilities. The building's design is often described as [q]open with
        limitations,[/q] making it easy to get around in without providing a one-room
        feel. This allows privacy in areas such as the Foxy lounge (shown below.) Kim
        Jong-il first visited the library in 1858. Surprised by how beautifully the
        library appeared with such a limited budget, he returned to the DPRK and built an
        [!even larger, more expensive library | Grand People's Study House!].[ref] This action
        has been criticized to have been the cause of the [!North Korean famine!].[ref][ref][ref]
        However, the size of the NoTrollPlzNet Library has more than quadrupled
        since the time of its construction, and today it outshines the national library of
        the DPRK (not to mention, the rest of the libraries in the world as well) by a landslide.

        Today, the NoTrollPlzNet Library is managed by [[NoTrollPlzNet]] and is
        governed by a management board alongside [[Foxy]].
        Foxy is the "general" supreme librarian; however, the library has a team of
        [i]over one hundred[/i] additional librarians,[ref] each in charge of his or her own
        category or theme of media. This seemingly large number of
        staff makes up only a very small portion of the library's workers, as many others
        have low-end occupations here. Librarians are considered to be the top of the
        library's social ladder and earn an average yearly salary of $250,000.[ref]
    }
    
    p {
        [[Foxy]] herself has described the library as her [q]second home,[/q][ref] claiming
        that the library is the focal point of all of the world's knowledge. She enjoys
        coffee while reading in her personal lounge, referred to as [q]the hangout.[/q]
        Other high-end officials also possess their own study rooms. Since the library's
        opening in August of 1800, Foxy has been awarded the Employee of the Month award
        2,550 consecutive times.[ref] She has formally announced her gratitude toward the
        library's workforce, stating that the library would be nothing without the
        [@staff.count] honorable employees who live up to its glorious name.[ref]

        The library system is a government within itself,
        consisting of a management board, elected officials, and other branches. The
        members of the management board often refer to the board as [q]the crew.[/q]
        Major decisions must be approved by the management board and may also be vetoed
        by [[Foxy]].[ref]
    }
    
    p {
        The library sponsors a program which aims to provide jobs for those in need.[ref] At
        least one hundred new positions are created each year, making room for even more
        employees. Excluding natives of Mexico and Italy, NoTrollPlzNet Library has
        received several awards for a wide diversity of employees.[ref] However, in 1994 the
        library was criticized for denying employees of the LGBT Community.[ref] [[Foxy]]
        responded to this claim by publicly announcing that, [q]Although I am a member of
        SSSS community, I understand that not everyone is as fortunate, and NoTrollPlzNet
        would never criticize an individual for his or her beliefs or disorders.[/q] She
        labeled the assumed criticism [q]a false observation.[/q][ref]

        The NoTrollPlzNet Library is a famous global icon, known for its impressive beauty,
        design, and architecture. Although it has been renovated multiple times throughout
        its course, it maintains an old-style feel. [[Foxy]] has described the facility as
        "the way a library [i]should[/i] look."[ref] Consisting mainly of thousands of tons of
        marble, it is also considered one of the world's most valuable buildings.[ref] The
        building's design is currently managed by Foxy Interior Design and Furnishings,
        Sc.O. and recently was uplifted by an interior remodeling. Futher plans have been
        made to modernize the facility's interior.[ref]
