HOW TO PICKUP

I don't feel like working on this right now, but I don't want to forget where I left off.

Months ago, I was in the process of implementing a block type registration API.
See Wikifier::Block::References for an example. I need to fix blockmanager's
register methods and such... register_block register_format.

the create_block should check if a module is loaded by if the block type (or i.e. 
blah1-blah2 = blah1)... haha.

thx
