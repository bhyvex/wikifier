# Language

Wikifier's unique language is designed specifically for easy legibility.

## Blocks

The fundamental component of the Wikifier language is the block. Each block
belongs to a specific type, and each type provides a unique function. For
example, `infobox{}` displays a table of information associated with an
article. `imagebox{}` displays an image preview with a caption and link to a
full-sized image.

Many blocks may contain text as well as other blocks. Each block type handles
the data inside of it differently.

See [Blocks](blocks.md) for a list of built-in block types.

### Block syntax

Blocks can have names: Some do, and some don't. Each block type may use its name
for a different purpose. For example, section blocks use the name to display a
title header over the section. Infoboxes use the name to display a title along
the top of the box. The syntax for blocks is as follows.


**Nameless blocks**

    blocktype {
        ...
    }

Example

    imagebox {
        description: [[Foxy]], supreme librarian;
        align: left;
        file: foxy2.png;
        width: 100px;
    }

**Named blocks**

    blocktype [block name] {
        ...
    }

Example

    sec [Statistics] {
        NoTrollPlzNet Library's online division currently hosts
        [b][@stats.site.articles][/b] articles.
    }


## Variables

Wikifier supports string and boolean variables.

### Assignment

String variables look like this:
```
@some_variable: The value;
@another_variable: You can escape semicolons\; I think;
```

Boolean variables look like this:
```
@some_bool;
```

### Retrieval

Once variables are assigned, they are typically used in formatted text. You can
use variables anywhere that formatted text is accepted:
```
sec {
    This is a paragraph inside a section. I am allow to use [b]bold text[/b],
    as well as [@variables].
}
```

### Formatted variables

By the way, you can use text formatting within string variables, including other
embedded variables:
```
@site: MyWiki;
@name: John;
@welcome: Welcome to [@site], [@name].
```

The `%variable` syntax can also be used within `html{}` and `format{}` blocks.
This yields the HTML generated by the text formatter from the variable's
contents:
```
@some.var: it has [b]bold text[/b] in it;
format {
    <div>[%some.var]</div>
}
```

### Attributes

Also, variables can have attributes. This helps to organize things:
```
@page.name: Hello World!;
@page.author: John Doe;
```

### Conditionals

You can use conditionals on boolean variables:
```
if [@page.draft] {
    Note to self: Don't forget to publish this page.
}
else {
    Thanks for checking out my page.
}
```

## Text formatting

Many block types can contain formatted text. Square brackets `[` and `]` are
used for text formatting tokens.

**Basic formatting**
* `[b]bold text[/b]` - **bold text**
* `[s]strikethrough text[/s]` - ~~strikethrough text~~
* `[i]italicized text[/i]` - *italicized text*
* `superscript[^]text[/^]` - superscript<sup>text</sup>
* `[Aquamarine]some colored text[/]`

**Variables**
* `[@some.variable]` - normal variable
* `[%some.variable]` - interpolable variable
* See [Variables](#variables) above

**Links**
* `[[ Page name ]]` - internal wiki page link
* `[! Page name !]` - external wiki page link
* `[~ Cat name ~]` - category link
* `[$ http://google.com $]` - external site link
* For any link type, you can change the display text:
  `[$ Google | http://google.com $]`

**References**
* `[ref]` - a fake reference. just to make your wiki look credible.
* `[1]` - an actual reference number. a true reference.

**Characters**
* `[nl]` - a line break
* `[--]` - an en dash
* `[---]` - an em dash
* `[&copy]` - HTML entities by name
* `[&#34]` - HTML entities by number
