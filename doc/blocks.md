# Blocks

This is the list of built-in block types. For a syntactical explanation of
blocks, see [Language](language.md).

* [Blocks](#blocks)
  * [Clear](#clear) - CSS clear
  * [Code](#code) - Block of code (`<pre>` and `<code>`)
  * [Format](#format) - Embedded HTML with formatted text
  * [Map](#map) - Key-value datatype
  * [History](#history) - Table of chronological events
  * [Html](#html) - Embedded HTML
  * [Image](#image) - `<img>`
  * [Imagebox](#imagebox) - `<img>` with border, link, and description
  * [Infobox](#infobox) - Table to summarize article information
  * [Invisible](#invisible) - Silences all other blocks
  * [List](#list) - An ordered list datatype as well as `<ul>`
  * [Model](#model) - Wikifier templates
  * [Paragraph](#paragraph) - `<p>`
  * [Section](#section) - Article section with optional header
  * [Style](#style) - Use CSS with Wikifier

## Clear

Creates an empty `<div>` with `clear: both`.

```
clear{}
```

This is mostly useless now that the built-in wiki classes `clear`, `clear-left`,
and `clear-right` can be used on any block:

```
p.clear {
    This will clear both sides.
}

p.clear-left {
    This will clear the left side.
}

p.clear-right {
    This will clear the right side.
}
```

## Code

Used to wrap some code. The contents will not be formatted, except that
curly brackets must be escaped.

```
code {
    someCode();
    function someCode() \{
        return "You have to escape those.";
    \}
}
```

## Format

Same as [`html{}`](#html), except that text formatting is permitted. Often
used with [models](#model).

```
format {
    <div>
        This is some HTML.
        b]Wikifier formatting[/b] is allowed.
    </div>
}
```

## Map

An *ordered* key-value map data type. Many other block types inherit from this
when they accept key-value options.

Yields no HTML.

```
map {
    key:        value;
    other key:  another value;
}
```

**Syntax for pairs**. Each pair is separated by a colon (`:`). The left side is
the key; the right is the value. The key must be plain text (no formatting
permitted). Colons (`:`) can be included in the key be prefixing them with the
escape character (`\`). The value may contain
[formatted text](language.md#text-formatting) or a single
[block](language.md#blocks) but not both simultaneously. Values are terminated
with the semicolon (`;`). If the value is text, semicolons can be included by
prefixing them with the escape character (`\`). Colons (`:`) do not need to be
escaped in the value.
```
map {
    /* the value of this pair is a block */
    key: list {
        a;
        b;
        c;
    };

    /* the value of this pair is text with an escaped semicolon */
    other key:  another value\; with a semicolon;
}
```

**Syntax for standalone values**. In addition to pairs, maps can contain
anonymous values. These are values which are not mapped to a key. Like values in
pairs, standalone values are terminated by the semicolon (`;`). If the value is
text, it should be prefixed with a colon (`:`). The advantage of this is that
colons consequently need not be escaped in the value. For blocks, this prefixing
colon is not required. Semicolons (`;`) can be included in standalone text
values by prefixing them with the escape character (`\`).
```
infobox [My Article] {

    /* this is here to demonstrate that "invisible" blocks (those which
       yield no HTML) are NOT map values and therefore do NOT need to be
       terminated with the semicolon
   */
    style {
        border: 1px solid red;
    }

    /* this anonymous value is a block */
    image {
        file: mypic.jpg;
    };

    /* this anonymous value is text, so it must be prefixed with a colon */
    :This is some text.;
}
```

**Attributes**. Maps and all map-based block types support attribute fetching
and assignment, which allows you to retrieve and set their values using the
Wikifier variable attribute syntax.
```
/* define the infobox in a variable so we can access attributes */
@person: infobox [Britney Spears] {
    First name:     Britney;
    Last name:      Spears;
    Age:            35;
};

/* display the infobox */
@person {}

/* access attributes from it elsewhere
   btw this works for all map-based block types */
sec {
    Did you know that [@person.First_name] [@person.Last_name] is
    [@person.Age] years old?
}
```

**Duplicate keys**. As some block types such as [`infobox{}`](#infobox) and
[`history{}`](#history) use the pairs of a map to display table rows in the
generated HTML, keys may be duplicated. When using a key more than once, both
pairs will be displayed in the resulting HTML, but because only one value can be
associated with each key internally, duplicate keys are suffixed with `_n` where
`n` is incremented for each occurrence, starting at 2.
```
infobox {
    Name:   Britney;    /* shows Name, internally Name   */
    Name:   Spears;     /* shows Name, internally Name_2 */
}
```

**Key fixing**. The original characters of a key will be displayed, but the
internal key will be fixed by replacing all non-word characters with an
underscore (`_`).
```
infobox {
    First name:     Britney;    /* shows First name, internally First_name    */
    First name:     Brittany;   /* shows First name, internally First_name_2  */
    Last name:      Spears;     /* shows Last name, internally Last_name      */
    Last/name:      Speers;     /* shows Last name, internally Last_name_2    */
}
```

## History

Displays a timeline of chronological events in a table.

```
history {
    1900: A new century began.;
    2000: A new millennium began.;
}
```

## Html

Used to embed some HTML. See also [`format{}`](#format).

```
html {
    <div>
        This is HTML. Nothing inside will be changed,
        but please note that curly brackets \{ and \}
        must be escaped.
    </div>
}
```

## Image

A simple image element. Typically for embedding standalone images with a nice
border and optional caption you should use [`imagebox{}`](#imagebox) instead.
However, `image{}` is often used inside other block types.

```
infobox [Planet Earth] {
    image {
        file: planet-earth.jpg;
        desc: Earth from space;
    };
    Type: Planet;
    Population: 23 billion;
    Galaxy: Milky Way;
}
```

**Options**
* __file__ - _required_, filename of the full-size image.
* __width__ - image width in pixels.
* __height__ - image height in pixels.
* __align__ - `left` or `right` to specify which side of the container the
  image should clear. defaults to `right`.
* __float__ - alias for __align__.

If neither __width__ nor __height__ is specified, the image will be full-size,
unless its size is constrained by a container. In the above
[`infobox{}`](#infobox) example, the image size is automatically constrained by
the width of the infobox, so dimensions do not need to be specified.

## Imagebox

Embeds an image with an automatic border. It will be either left or right
aligned. It can have an optional caption. Also, clicking it takes you to the
full-sized image.

```
imagebox {
    file:   planet-earth.jpg;
    width:  300px;
    align:  right;
    desc:   Earth from space;
}
```

**Options**
* __file__ - _required_, filename of the full-size image.
* __width__ - image width in pixels.
* __height__ - image height in pixels.
* __align__ - `left` or `right` to specify which side of the container the
  imagebox should clear. defaults to `right`.
* __float__ - alias for __align__.

If neither __width__ nor __height__ is specified, the image will be full-size,
unless its size is constrained by a container.

## Infobox

Displays a summary of information for an article. Usually there is just one
per article, and it occurs before the first section.

```
@page.title: Earth;

infobox [Planet Earth] {

    /* many infoboxes start with an image of the subject */
    /* the image dimensions are dictated by the infobox  */
    image {
        file: planet-earth.jpg;
    };

    /* standalone text should be prefixed with colon */
    :Earth from space;

    Type:           [[ Planet ]];
    Population:     23 billion;
    Galaxy:         Milky Way;
}

sec {
    [b]Earth[/b] is the planet on which we live.
}
```

You can organize the information in sections with `infosec{}`. Each can
optionally have a title as well.
```
@page.title: United States;

infobox [United States of America] {
    infosec {  
        Capital:        [! Washington, DC !];  
        Largest city:   [! New York City !];    
    };
    infosec [Goverment] {
        :[! Federal presidential constitutional republic | Republic !];   
        President:              [! Donald Trump !];
        Vice President:         [! Mike Pence !];
        Speaker of the House:   [! Paul Ryan !];
        Chief Justice:          [! John Roberts !];
    };
    infosec [Independence[nl]from [! Great Britain !]] {
        Declaration:            July 4, 1776;
        Confederation:          March 1, 1781;
        Treaty of Paris:        September 3, 1783;
        Constitution:           June 21, 1788;
        Last polity admitted:   March 24, 1976;
    };
}

sec {
    [b]The United States[/b] ([b]USA[/b], [b]US[/b], [b]America[/b], officially
    [b]the United States of America[/b]) is the country in which 100% of
    American residents live.
}
```

## Invisible

Silences whatever's inside.

```
invisible {
    sec {
        Normally this would show a paragraph.
        But since it's inside an invisible block, it shows nothing.
    }
}
```

## List

An ordered list datatype. It may be used by other block types. By itself though,
it yields an unordered list element (`<ul>`).

```
list {
    Item one;
    Item two;
    Item three can have an escaped semicolon\; I think;
}
```

**Syntax**. A value may contain
[formatted text](language.md#text-formatting) or a single
[block](language.md#blocks) but not both simultaneously. Values are terminated
by the semicolon (`;`). If the value is text, additional semicolons may be
included by prefixing them with the escape character (`\`).

**Attributes**. Lists support attribute fetching and assignment, which allows
you to retrieve and set their values using the wikifier variable attribute
syntax.
```
@greetings: list {
    hello;
    bonjour;
    buenos dias;
};

@greetings.2: hola;

sec [Greetings around the world] {
    [@greetings]
}
```

## Model

Allows you to embed a template. See [Models](models.md).

## Paragraph

The name says it all. You can call it `paragraph{}` or `p{}`. Or you can
call it nothing because stray text within `sec{}` blocks is assumed to be a
paragraph.

```
sec [My Section] {
    p {
        A paragraph.
    }
    p {
        Another.
    }
}
```

Same as
```
sec [My Section] {
    A paragraph.

    Another.
}
```

## Section

You can organize the content of an article by dividing it into sections.
Sections typically have title headers, except for the first one. The first
section on a page is considered the introduction. It always has the page title
as its header, so even if specify some text there, it will not be considered. As
for the rest, the header will be displayed at the appropriate level.

Also spelled `sec{}`.

```
sec {
    This is my intro section. No need to put a title here, since the page title
    will be displayed atop this section.
}

sec [Info] {
    Here we go. This one has a title.

    By the way, a blank line starts a new paragraph.
}

sec [More stuff] {
    You can also put sections inside each other.

    sec [Little header] {
        This section will have a smaller header, since it is nested deeper
        than the top-level sections.
    }
}
```

## Style

Allows you to use CSS with Wikifier.

See [Styling](styling.md).

```
imagebox {
    file:   some-image.png;
    width:  500px;
    style {
        padding: 5px;
        background-color: red;
    }
}
```
